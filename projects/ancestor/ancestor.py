# 1. Describe problem in graph terminology
# What are the vertecis/nodes? numbers/people
# What are the edges ? if a dcscendant/parent

# Build graph or write getNeighbors()
# Can do either

# What algorithm in this situation?
# BFS, DFS, BFT, DFT

# Depth VS Breadth
# BF --> shortest path
# DF --> heads to leaves first
# DF can be recursive, BF Cannot

# distance param added during lecture


def earliest_ancestor(ancestors, starting_node, distance=0):
    # Iterate over all ancestors
    # add each node to graph
    # add each edge to graph

    # run a traversal

    # modify it so as you go, you keep track of the nodes that's farthes away
    pass
